# CSB320 Project 1
Analyzes diabetes data from two datasets and trains multiple machine learning models for class prediction, including:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Environment Setup
To install dependencies for the project by running the requirements.yml file, run the following commands in your terminal
```
conda env create -f requirements.yml
conda activate ml-env
```
To reduce code redundancy, since the same functions are run in different Juypter Notebooks corresponding to different datasets, lib.py contains utility functions for data visualization, preprocessing, and model evaluation and comparison.

## Performance Comparison
Overall, 

#### Which models performed best on smaller vs. larger datasets?

#### How different models handle imbalanced data?

#### Compare results from using train/test split and using cross-fold validation.

#### Compare and contrast results from the primary dataset (diabetes.csv) and the secondary dataset.
