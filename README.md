# CSB320 Project 1
Analyzes diabetes data from two datasets and trains multiple machine learning models for class prediction, including:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Environment Setup

## Performance Comparison

#### Which models performed best on smaller vs. larger datasets?

#### How different models handle imbalanced data?

#### Compare results from using train/test split and using cross-fold validation.

#### Compare and contrast results from the primary dataset (diabetes.csv) and the secondary dataset.
